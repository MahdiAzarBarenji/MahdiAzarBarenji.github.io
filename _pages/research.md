## Master's Thesis
Studying the integration of generated green hydrogen from renewable sources into the existing grids from CFD and thermodynamics insight. A multi-species approach through ideal and real gas equations of state (EoS), as well as mixing/combining rules, is carried out. For the sake of High-Performance Computation (HPC), UBC Advanced Research Computing (UBC ARC) and ComputeCanada platforms are used. ANSYS Fluent is used for the numerical simulation section, and the multi-species codes are developed and compiled separately via C/C++. The impacts of advection, diffusion, and stratification between species are investigated in the analytical part.

## Bachelor's Thesis
Comparing the efficiency of Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and Kalina cycle system 111 (KCS111) based on different decision variables. The results were compared with some benchmarks in the literature. From a thermodynamics perspective, and apart from KCS111's complex configuration and high costs, it is more efficient than the base cycle, KCS11.
