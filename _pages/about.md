Hi, Thanks for standing by!

My name is Arash, a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering at The University of British Columbia (UBC), under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/sunny-ri-li/" target="_blank" style="color:#0000FF; text-decoration:none;">Sunny Ri Li</a>. My current research aligns with one of Canada's key climate plans, aiming to contribute towards a cleaner planet. Specifically, I am focusing on the integration of 5-20 mole% hydrogen into the existing natural grid infrastructure in British Columbia, Canada. This approach aims to significantly reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, targeting a 40-45% decrease from 2005 levels by the year 2030.

Through this experience, I have gained exposure to a wide range of subjects, encompassing fundamental fluid dynamics, thermal sciences, and high-performance computation (HPC). My expertise lies in the study of thermal-fluid systems using supercomputing techniques, as well as conducting system-scale analysis of renewable energy systems. Additionally, recognizing their significant relevance in today's engineering society and industry, I have been actively expanding my knowledge in machine learning (ML) and data science alongside my primary research.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Tabriz, in August 2020. My thesis, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=3fiuBk0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra" target="_blank" style="color:#0000FF; text-decoration:none;">SMS Mahmoudi</a>, was upon the thermodynamic and exergy study of Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and a new type with three pressure levels.
