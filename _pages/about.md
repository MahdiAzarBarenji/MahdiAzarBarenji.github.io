Hi there! Thanks for standing by!

My name is Arash, a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering at The University of British Columbia (UBC), under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/sunny-ri-li/" target="_blank" style="color:#0000FF; text-decoration:none;">Sunny Ri Li</a>. My current research is aligned with one of Canada’s primary climate plans. Even on a minor scale, it feels pleasing when one’s contributions could result in a cleaner planet. I am specifically focusing on blending 5-20%mol renewable hydrogen into the existing grids to reduce emissions by 40-45% from 2005 levels by 2030.

This experience has exposed me to a broad range of topics, from fundamental fluid dynamics and thermal sciences to high-performance computation (HPC). My primary area of expertise includes but is not limited to studying thermal-fluid systems via supercomputing techniques as well as system-scale analysis of renewable energy systems. For their wide application in this day and age's engineering society and industry, I have been also broadening my knowledge in machine learning (ML) and data science in parallel to my primary research.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Tabriz, in August 2020. My thesis, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=3fiuBk0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra" target="_blank" style="color:#0000FF; text-decoration:none;">SMS Mahmoudi</a>, was upon the thermodynamic and exergy study of Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and a new type with three pressure levels.

Here is my <b><a href="https://arashjkh.github.io/files/CV_Arash_Jalil_Khabbazi.pdf" target="_blank" style="color:#0000FF; text-decoration:none;">CV</a></b>.
