Thanks for stopping by! I'm a PhD Student in the Mechanical Engineering Department and <a href="https://engineering.purdue.edu/Herrick" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration:none;">Herrick Laboratories</a> at Purdue University, working under the guidance of Prof. <a href="https://kevinjkircher.com/" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration:none;">Kevin Kircher</a>. My research centers on machine learning, optimization, and control algorithms for heating and cooling systems in commercial buildings. 

I recently completed my Masterâ€™s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the School of Engineering at the University of British Columbia (UBC) in Canada, where I was supervised by Prof. <a href="https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/sunny-ri-li/" target="_blank" style="color: black; text-decoration:none;">Sunny Ri Li</a>. During this academic journey, my research delved into Mixing Hydrogen into Natural Gas Distribution Pipelines, aligning with Canada's pivotal "Net-Zero Emissions by 2050" initiative. This visionary plan aspires to make substantial reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, aiming for a 40-45% decrease from 2005 levels by 2030. My contributions to this field have been acknowledged with notable accolades, including the Best Presentation Award at CSME 2022 and the Best Paper Award at CSME 2023.

Prior to that, I achieved my Bachelor's Degree in Mechanical Engineering with the highest distinction from the University of Tabriz in Iran.
