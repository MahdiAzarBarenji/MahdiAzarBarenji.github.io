Thanks for standing by! I am a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering at the School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/sunny-ri-li/" target="_blank">Sunny Ri Li</a>. My current research is aligned with one of Canada’s primary climate plans. Even on a minor scale, it feels pleasing when one’s contributions could result in a cleaner planet. I am specifically focusing on blending 5-20\%mol renewable hydrogen into the existing grids to reduce emissions by 40-45% from 2005 levels by 2030.

This experience has exposed me to a broad range of topics, from fundamental fluid dynamics and thermal sciences to high-performance computation (HPC). My primary area of expertise includes but is not limited to studying thermal-fluid systems via high-performance computing (HPC) techniques as well as system-scale analysis of renewable energy systems. I am also broadening my knowledge in machine learning (ML) and data science for their wide application in today's engineering problems.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Tabriz, in August 2020. My thesis, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=3fiuBk0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra" target="_blank">SMS Mahmoudi</a>, was upon the thermodynamic and exergy study of Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and a new type with three pressure levels.

Here is my <b><a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/15KDkA2jfwnZ5U6zae2aigpx8WAEac0Fz/preview" target="_blank">CV</a></b>.
