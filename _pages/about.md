Thanks for standing by! I am a Master’s student in Mechanical Engineering at the School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/sunny-ri-li/" target="_blank">Sunny Ri Li</a>. My research thesis focuses on the green hydrogen mixing and stratification within the existing grids in British Columbia for reducing GHG emissions through computational fluid dynamics (CFD) and analytical approaches.

My primary area of expertise includes but is not limited to studying thermal-fluid systems via high-performance computing (HPC) techniques as well as system-scale analysis of renewable energy systems. I am also broadening my knowledge in machine learning (ML) and data science for their wide application in today's engineering problems.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree in Mechanical Engineering from the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Tabriz, in August 2020. My thesis, under the supervision of Professor <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=3fiuBk0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra" target="_blank">SMS Mahmoudi</a>, was upon the thermodynamic and exergy study of Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and a new type with three pressure levels.
