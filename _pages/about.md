This is the front page of a website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) and hosted on GitHub pages. [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com) is a free service in which websites are built and hosted from code and data stored in a GitHub repository, automatically updating when a new commit is made to the respository. This template was forked from the [Minimal Mistakes Jekyll Theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/) created by Michael Rose, and then extended to support the kinds of content that academics have: publications, talks, teaching, a portfolio, blog posts, and a dynamically-generated CV. You can fork [this repository](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io) right now, modify the configuration and markdown files, add your own PDFs and other content, and have your own site for free, with no ads! An older version of this template powers my own personal website at [stuartgeiger.com](http://stuartgeiger.com), which uses [this Github repository](https://github.com/staeiou/staeiou.github.io).

Bio
======
I am a Master’s (M.A.Sc.) student in Mechanical Engineering at the School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia. My supervisor is Prof. Sunny Li. My research thesis focuses on the numerical and analytical study of green hydrogen integration into the existing grids for reducing GHG emissions and for heating homes.

My primary research interest is Thermofluids. I am also expanding my interest in machine learning and data science for its wide application in engineering.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree (B.Sc.) in Mechanical Engineering from the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Tabriz, in August 2020. My thesis was upon the thermodynamic and exergy study of Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and a new type with three pressure levels.
