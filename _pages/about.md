I am a Master’s (M.A.Sc.) student in Mechanical Engineering at the School of Engineering, The University of British Columbia, under the supervision of Professor [Sunny Li](https://engineering.ok.ubc.ca/about/contact/sunny-ri-li/). My research thesis focuses on the numerical and analytical study of green hydrogen integration into the existing grids for reducing GHG emissions in British Columbia.

My primary research interest is Thermofluids, including but not limited to Renewable Energy Systems, Heat and Mass Transfer, and Multiphase Flows. I am also broadening my knowledge in Machine Learning and Data Science for its wide application in today's engineering problems.

I received my Bachelor’s Degree (B.Sc.) in Mechanical Engineering from the Mechanical Engineering Department, University of Tabriz, in August 2020. My thesis, under the supervision of Professor [SMS Mahmoudi](https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=3fiuBk0AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra), was upon the thermodynamic and exergy study of Kalina cycle system 11 (KCS11) and a new type with three pressure levels.

Here is my [curriculum vitae](../files/CV_Arash_Jalil_Khabbazi.pdf).
